# Brief Conclusion 

儒家思想是先秦诸子百家思想的重要分支，也是中国传统文化的重要组成部分。儒家思想与中华文明伴生伴行，深刻影响着当今中国的国家治理、社会观念与思想文化，也对东亚文化圈的形成起到了直接的推动作用。

商周时期，儒家思想舒展萌芽，“儒”的观念逐渐在齐鲁大地上传播。作为儒家思想的创始人，孔子将“仁礼忠恕”、“为政以德”作为修身治国的核心道义。战国时期，孟子、荀子等人在诸侯征伐与百家争鸣中进一步发展了儒家思想，提出了“民贵君轻”、“礼乐化人”的著名论断，儒家思想在适应社会需求中进一步体系化和完整化。战国后期，儒学在诸子百家中蔚然大宗。“焚书坑儒”后，儒家思想在秦朝趋于沉寂。

西汉初年，统一的中央集权国家需要新的政治思想来扭转内外松弛的局势，董仲舒提出“独尊儒术”、“天人合一”的主张，并以此维护封建王朝的统治秩序。随着儒家学说成为国家授官任爵的主要标准，儒学逐渐走向制度化和宗教化，成为意识形态的主流。魏晋至隋唐是儒学的危机时期，儒、道、佛的学说在纷争中融合，“三百年间无大儒”，这一时期儒学发展的脚步趋缓。

唐末宋初，长期以来的社会失序呼唤着儒家思想的新陈代谢，佛道两家的日益坐大对儒学提出了严峻的挑战。这一背景下，重构自身的价值体系，论证传统伦理规范成为儒家思想进一步发展必须担负的重任，新儒学，也即宋明理学应运而生。程朱理学将孔孟之政治伦理思想升华至追问世界终极存在之本体论高度，新儒学充分发挥儒学道德修养方面的社会功能，促成儒学质的飞跃。

明清时期是儒家思想的继承与批判时期。随着资本主义萌芽的产生与中央集权的空前强化，黄宗羲、顾炎武、王夫之等人提出了反对君主专制的早期民主思想和工商皆本的经济主张，在批判中发展着儒家思想。近代以来，“尊孔复古”与“全面西化”的思想潮流相互激荡，学者们开始思考关于孔子评价和中国传统文化的批判与继承。

新中国成立以来，共产革命的左倾思潮破坏了儒家思想的土壤，儒家在中国大陆与海外的发展均陷入了沉寂。改革开放以来，儒学问题探讨的深度与广度双向拓展，现代“新儒学”在探索中发展，但总的来说，并没有形成统一而权威的当代儒学体系。

Confucianism is an important branch of the pre-Qin Hundred Schools of Thought and a significant component of traditional Chinese culture. It has evolved alongside Chinese civilization, profoundly influencing contemporary China's governance, social concepts, and cultural thought, and has played a direct role in the formation of the East Asian cultural sphere.

During the Shang and Zhou periods, Confucian thought began to sprout, with the concept of "Ru" (Confucian scholars) gradually spreading across the land of Qi and Lu. As the founder of Confucianism, Confucius emphasized "benevolence, propriety, loyalty, and forgiveness" and "governing with virtue" as the core principles for personal conduct and state governance. During the Warring States period, thinkers such as Mencius and Xunzi further developed Confucianism amid the conflicts of feudal lords and the Hundred Schools of Thought, proposing famous doctrines like "the people are of paramount importance, while the ruler is of lesser importance" and "using rites and music to civilize the people." Confucianism became more systematized and complete in response to societal needs. By the late Warring States period, Confucianism had become a dominant school of thought among the Hundred Schools. However, it fell into decline during the Qin Dynasty's "burning of books and burying of scholars."

At the beginning of the Western Han Dynasty, the unified centralized state needed a new political ideology to stabilize internal and external tensions. Dong Zhongshu proposed the ideas of "suppressing the hundred schools and honoring only Confucianism" and "the unity of heaven and humanity" to maintain the feudal order. As Confucian doctrines became the main criteria for official appointments, Confucianism gradually became institutionalized and religious, emerging as the dominant ideology. From the Wei and Jin periods to the Sui and Tang dynasties, Confucianism faced a crisis as Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist teachings blended and conflicted. This period saw a slowdown in Confucian development, with "no great Confucians in three hundred years."

By the late Tang and early Song periods, long-term social disorder called for a renewal of Confucian thought. The growing influence of Buddhism and Taoism posed significant challenges to Confucianism. In this context, Confucianism needed to reconstruct its value system and justify traditional ethical norms, leading to the emergence of Neo-Confucianism, also known as Song-Ming Rationalism. The Cheng-Zhu school elevated Confucius and Mencius' political and ethical ideas to the level of metaphysical inquiry into the ultimate nature of existence. Neo-Confucianism significantly enhanced the social function of Confucian moral cultivation, marking a qualitative leap for Confucianism.

The Ming and Qing periods were times of both inheritance and critique for Confucian thought. With the rise of capitalist tendencies and the unprecedented strengthening of centralized authority, thinkers like Huang Zongxi, Gu Yanwu, and Wang Fuzhi introduced early democratic ideas opposing monarchical despotism and advocated for economic principles valuing both agriculture and commerce. These critiques helped develop Confucian thought further. In modern times, the intellectual currents of "revering Confucius and restoring antiquity" and "comprehensive Westernization" clashed, prompting scholars to reconsider Confucius' legacy and the critique and inheritance of traditional Chinese culture.

Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, leftist revolutionary currents have undermined the foundations of Confucian thought, leading to its dormancy both on the mainland and overseas. Since the reform and opening-up era, the exploration of Confucian issues has expanded in both depth and breadth. Modern "New Confucianism" continues to develop through exploration, but overall, a unified and authoritative contemporary Confucian system has yet to emerge.
