## Ideological Tenets

### Han Dynasty: honoring only Confucianism

Dong Zhongshu (179 B.C. – 104 B.C.) was one of the key figures representing Confucianism during the Han dynasty. He proposed the cosmological concept of the unity of Heaven and humanity, advocating for a close connection and mutual influence between humans and all things in the universe. He emphasized the idea of Tianming (the Mandate of Heaven), believing that human destiny is constrained and arranged by the will of Heaven. He advocated for rulers to align themselves with the Mandate of Heaven, governing the state based on it, implementing benevolent governance to maintain social stability and the well-being of the people. Dong Zhongshu also advocated for the divine bestowment of royal authority, believing that the authority of rulers is bestowed by Heaven. Rulers, as individuals appointed by Heaven, should exercise political power based on the Mandate of Heaven to uphold social order and stability.

### Wei, Jin to Sui and Tang: Institutionalized Confucianism

After the Eastern Jin and the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and extending into the Sui and Tang periods, the influence of Buddhist thought surpassed that of Neo-Daoism (Xuanxue), playing a significant role in the intellectual cultivation of the scholar-official class. Therefore, during the approximately seven hundred years from the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties to the end of the Five Dynasties in the late Tang, Confucianism continued to function primarily in its institutionalized political aspects, upheld by the ruling class.

Overall, from the Wei and Jin periods to the Sui and Tang periods, the ritualization of Confucianism was closely related to its institutionalization in politics, with both processes occurring simultaneously and interdependently. The former served to establish and consolidate the latter. The formation and strengthening of Confucianism's function in the social and political spheres consequently weakened its role as a framework for general ethical and moral cultivation and as a vehicle for political ideals.

## Historical Status

During the Han dynasty, the political influence of Confucianism continued to expand, becoming an essential theoretical foundation for rulers to formulate policies and govern the state. The Confucian principle of benevolent governance received attention from rulers, and Confucian scholars became significant targets for the selection and training of officials. Confucian classics also became the main content of official education. Confucian ideology permeated various levels of society, influencing people's behavior and moral concepts. The Confucian concepts of rituals and music were widely applied in social life, and Confucian educational ideas also affected both family education and societal norms.
