# Emerging Stage

The academic community generally believes that the concept of "Ru"(儒) originated during China's Shang and Zhou periods. The term "Confucianism" first appeared in the "Records of the Grand Historian"(史记) : "The people of Lu all follow Confucian teachings, and Zhu Jia is known for his chivalry."("鲁人皆以儒教，而朱家用侠闻。") This indicates that the State of Lu during the pre-Qin period was a place where Confucianism flourished. Confucius(孔子) systematically summarized the concept of "Ru" into a complete ideological system, thus he is regarded as the founder of Confucian thought. The Pre-Qin period was a crucial time for the formation and development of Confucianism. Confucian thought primarily emerged and gradually expanded during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Key figures representing Confucianism during this time include Confucius, Mencius, and Xunzi.

## Ideological Tenets

### Confucius

As mentioned earlier, Confucius was the most significant Confucian thinker during the Pre-Qin period, and his ideological tenets are mainly recorded in the "Analects." Confucius advocated for benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness, emphasizing the importance of harmonious relationships between individuals and the social order. He believed that through education and self-cultivation, everyone could become a "gentleman," characterized by moral excellence. Confucius also valued ritual and music systems, considering them as the foundation for maintaining social order and stability.

### Mencius

Mencius, following Confucius, was another important Confucian thinker, and his ideas are primarily documented in the "Mencius." Mencius further developed Confucius' notion of benevolent governance, proposing the viewpoint that "the people are the most important, followed by the altars of the land and grain, and the ruler is the lightest." He emphasized that rulers must implement benevolent governance, caring for the people, in order to legitimately exercise authority. Mencius also proposed the theory of innate goodness, believing that human nature is inherently good, and that every person possesses an innate drive towards goodness.

### Xunzi

Xunzi, another important figure of Confucianism during the Warring States period, is documented primarily in the book "Xunzi." In contrast to Mencius' theory of innate goodness, Xunzi proposed the theory of innate evil, suggesting that human nature is inherently wicked and requires the constraints of education and rituals to regulate human behavior. He emphasized the concept of "transforming nature through training," which means changing human nature through learning and self-cultivation to achieve social harmony. Xunzi also placed great importance on rituals and laws, considering them fundamental to maintaining social order.

## Historical Status

Just as the Qing dynasty scholar Wang Guowei(王国维) remarked, "The most dramatic changes in Chinese politics and culture occurred during the transition from the Shang to the Zhou dynasty." Confucianism continuously enriched and perfected during the Pre-Qin period, gradually forming a theoretical system guiding political governance and social life. This had a profound impact on Chinese history and culture. The core concepts of Confucianism during this period, such as benevolent governance, rituals and music, innate goodness or evil, laid the foundation for the significant position of Confucian thought in the intellectual history of China.
