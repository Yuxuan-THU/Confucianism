## Causes of Emergence

### Long-term social disorder

From the late 8th to the early 9th century, the Tang Dynasty experienced the turbulence of the An Lushan Rebellion. The once-powerful Tang Dynasty began to decline, and powerful regional military governors formed a situation where local military strength surpassed the central authority. This loss of political authority led to confusion in the social and intellectual spheres. Traditional Confucian ethical norms seemed to lose their proactive control over social thought and the unquestionable authority they once held. This state of intellectual disorder persisted until the early Northern Song Dynasty. In the 1060s, after the campaigns against the Southern Tang and Northern Han, the Northern Song government largely restored unity to China. However, after a long period of disorder and chaos, it was challenging for social thought to immediately return to a situation where Confucianism dominated. This provided an opportunity for the revival of Confucianism.

### Impact of Buddhism and Taoism

Since the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, Buddhism and Taoism have been eroding the territory of mainstream Confucianism through conflict, coordination, and adaptation processes. The Sinicization of Buddhism accelerated after the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and by the time of the Sixth Patriarch Huineng and the emergence of the sudden enlightenment Chan (Zen) sect, it had firmly established itself in Chinese intellectual circles. Although Sinicized Buddhism absorbed a large amount of Confucian thought and terminology to cater to the Chinese people's mindset, its goal of transcendence remained fundamentally different from the Confucian emphasis on worldly affairs. 

Meanwhile, indigenous Taoism, rooted in Chinese soil, began to rapidly develop by incorporating classical texts and borrowing some terminology from Buddhism. At one point during the Tang Dynasty, it was even honored as the state religion. The widespread popularity of Buddhism and Taoism, coupled with the central government's repeated overtures to them, undoubtedly sounded alarm bells for conservative Confucian intellectuals: Confucianism had reached a point where it required significant transformation to survive, or else it would struggle to maintain relevance.

### The demand to rebuild moral authority

Since the Han Dynasty, despite enduring numerous trials and undergoing several transformations, Confucianism's position as the paramount social and ethical ideology has only solidified. Confucian thought has long been the mainstream ideology in society and the foundational ideology for state and social authority. The Confucian system of values, ethical concepts, and the formalized ritualistic system has always been unquestionable. However, during the Tang and Song periods, due to intellectual chaos and the popularity of Buddhism and Taoism, people began to doubt traditional Confucianism and its lack of systematic ontological support.

This skepticism posed a challenge to traditional Confucianism, as it lacked a methodological approach to address the doubts arising from the absence of systematic ontological arguments. The problem facing intellectuals of the Song and Ming dynasties was clear: How to dispel people's doubts and restore the authority of Confucian ethical and moral thought? One of the central tasks in addressing this issue was to systematically justify traditional ethical norms and concepts.

## Historical Status

Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties represents the most speculative, comprehensive, and modern philosophical trend in the history of Chinese philosophy. The rise and development of Neo-Confucianism during the Song and Ming dynasties significantly restored Confucianism's social function in the realm of ethics and personal cultivation. This restoration complemented and reinforced the political institutional aspect of Confucianism, thereby enhancing its dual role in society's governance and education. After the Song and Ming periods, this harmonization of Confucianism's two levels of social functions—ethical cultivation and political institution—often led to the entanglement of issues originally belonging to the ethical domain with those of the political domain, making it difficult to distinguish between the two.

Moreover, since the ethical cultivation aspect directly served the political institutional aspect, norms that were originally based on principles of self-awareness and voluntary adherence often became enforced rules. These rules, governed by concepts such as "Heavenly principles" and "conscience," were sometimes more stringent than explicitly stated laws. Consequently, the regulations intended to guide moral behavior could be more severe than formal legal codes.Since modern times, especially since the May Fourth Movement, Confucianism has faced intense criticism, primarily targeting the Neo-Confucianism (Xingli) of this period.
